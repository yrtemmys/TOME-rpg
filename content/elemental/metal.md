#### Elemental/Metal, Metallumancer
*A mettalumancer uses metals and magneticism to bend, move, and create metal. From moving pennies up to crushing anything in your way.*
*Mistakes in casting can cause you to get a few coins lodged in your leg, or make the iron in your blood no longer be in your blood.*

Opposing School: *Elemental/Air*

#### Backfire
- Partial Backfire:
   - Metals like you. Small nearby metal objects fly to your hands or casting focus at rather high speeds.
- Moderate Backfire:
   - With great power comes great weight, apparently. Your body feels heavy as if it is made of steel. You can barely move for the attempted spells cast time, and spells take twice as long to cast during this period.
- Incredible Backfire:
   - You usually cant reach the metal inside of people. Luckily, no one will reach yours, as you just lost it all. You begin suffocating and will take permanent damage if hemoglobin levels are not restored within minutes.
