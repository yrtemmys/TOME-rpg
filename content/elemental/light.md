#### Elemental/Light, Photomancer
*Photomancers control light. They can dazzle and blind, create illusions, or focus the photons under their control into deadly L A S E R.*
*A failed spell might leave them blinded as light refuses to reach their eyes, or turn you into light, leaving you unable to act.*

#### Backfire
- Partial Backfire:
   - Your spell fails, and redirects all the light from your person. Your figure becomes concealed, yet the refraction leaves your position obvious. For the duration of your spell, you are blinded and roll with Hubris.
- Moderate Backfire:
   - Hard Light scatters around you while you move. You might end up restrained or hurt yourself on the fragments, if so: take moderate hurt.
- Incredible Backfire:
   - The spell goes catastrophically wrong. You're permanently blinded, and shunted from time as you turn to light. For the duration of the spell you can't act.
