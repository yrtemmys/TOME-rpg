#### Backfire:
- Partial Backfire: 
   - The spell burns you in return. This ignores all benefits. Take minor harm.
- Normal Backfire: 
   - The spell is out of fuel. Burn something inconvenient within range that matches the targets approximate volume. Might cause moderate damage.
- Incredible Backfire: 
   - Nothing burns as brightly as the fire of life itself. Your soul is sacrificed and utterly destroyed when you cast this spell, and one Attribute is stepped down twice. A volunteer can sacrifice their own soul instead. You may choose not to cast this spell.
