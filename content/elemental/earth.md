#### Elemental/Earth, Geomancer
*Geomancers move the **ROCK AND STONE** beneath their very feet, or create new matter from their mana. Once brought to shape, geomancy effects are as permanent as any natural formation and don't need further mana to sustain.*

*A failed spell might have you sink into the ground, or petrify your own body.*

Opposing School: *Elemental/Light*

   - Something inconvenient gets swallowed by the earth, never to be seen again.
