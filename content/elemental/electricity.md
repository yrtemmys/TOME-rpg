#### Elemental/Electricity, Electromancer
*An Electromancer harnesses the very power of lightning itself. Yet even applied in minute doses it proves remarkable effective.*
*Misuse of this school can cause the electric signals in your body to become jumbled, or worse yet: cause permanent nerve damage.*

Opposing School: *Elemental/Wood*

#### Backfire
- Partial Backfire:
   - Lightning finds the shortest path and strikes at an inconvenient target that's closer.
- Moderate Backfire:
   - Your electric signals go haywire. You collapse to the ground, and your next roll is with hubris.
- Incredible Backfire:
   - Electric Overload. Something *breaks* and you take permanent nerve damage somewhere in your body. Take major harm, and add an appropriate consequence to your sheet.
