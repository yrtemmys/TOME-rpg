Conceptual/Space, Raumurgist
	Prerequesite: d8 in Gravity
	A Raumurgist can bend space itself to their wims, stretching or contracting it, connecting two distant points together, or creating extradimensional spaces from nothing.
	Spacial Manipulations collapse too easily if they aren't contained by physical barriers, until a Mage gains the necessary skill at d6.

	-- Step	--Benefit		|--Example		|--Scope
	d12	none			|* of holding		|Bag
	d10	measure distances	|Portals		|Room
	 d8	sense distortions	|Extradimensional Spaces|Building
	 d6				|Open Space Distorion	|City 
	 d4	don't occupy space	|Space Erasure		|Planar
	
	Partial Backfire: Where were you again? Become disoriented and roll with Hubris on the next spell you cast.
	Normal Backfire: Teleport something or someone unintended somewhere inconvenient. 
	Incredible Backfire: You gain a massive boost of 2 step downs to range! Then you teleport to a random spot within that new range increment. Potentially in the sky.

Conceptual: Time, Zeitgheist
