Partial backfire - in attempts to summon something from your mind, it gets temporarily erased from it. You forget whatever it is you attempted to summon.

Normal backfire - You become controllable as easily as a summoned beast. For a small while, you follow commands you hear, albeit many dont know you are under this effect.

INCREDIBLE backfire - you summon a spacial beast hellbent on destroying you for your arrogance. Good luck. You roll with hubris against it.
You can choose not to cast this spell.
