#### Backfire
- Partial Backfire:
   - In attempts to summon something from your mind, it gets temporarily erased from it. You forget whatever it is you attempted to summon.
- Moderate Backfire:
   - You become controllable as easily as a summoned beast. For a small while, you follow commands you hear, albeit many dont know you are under this effect.
- Incredible Backfire:
   - You summon a spacial beast hellbent on destroying you for your arrogance. Good luck. You roll with hubris against it.
You can choose not to cast this spell.
