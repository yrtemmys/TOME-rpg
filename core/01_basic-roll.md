## The Basic Roll:

The most basic roll within TOME refers to the chart below. No matter what die you are rolling with, always refer back to these results:

| Roll | SUCCESS STATE | BACKFIRE STATE |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Incredible Success | none |
| 2 | Normal Success | none |
| 3 | Normal Success | none |
| 4 | Partial Success | none |
| 5 | Partial Success | none |
| 6 | none | none |
| 7 | none | none |
| 8 | none | Partial Backfire |
| 9 | none | Partial backfire |
| 10 | none | Normal Backfire |
| 11 | none | Normal Backfire |
| 12+ | none | Incredible Backfire |

A d20 functions the same way as a d12 for purposes of prerequesites and the like, it only has much worse success rates.
