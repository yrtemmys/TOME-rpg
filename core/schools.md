## Schools of Magic
Not every mage is equally good at all kinds of magic. 
You specialize in different Schools of Magic, a list of which can be provided by the GM at character creation, and added to during the campaign as new knowledge is unearthed.
Each School has an opposing School, which takes 2 Step-ups when you try to cast from it. [\*]
Every Mage starts with a d20 on all available Schools, which is to say, you can certainly try, but you'll probably hurt yourself.
When you gain Revelations within a School of Magic, you step down one of that schools Spell Power Dice.
When you cast a spell from a School of Magic you're invested in, use its power dice. For the Effect Attribute, refer to the floor and ceiling to see what effects you can create.
When you cast a spell from multiple different Schools of Magic, combine all power dice into an ordered list, and pick the median 6 as your spell power dice.

The GM will usually provide a System of Magic for you to use. A system is a collection of different spell schools that you can learn. Some systems may include:

> **Elemental**: *Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Metal, Wood*

> **Conceptual**: *Space, Time, Light, Dark*

> **Traditions**: *Arcane, Occult, Divine, Primal*

> **Gygaxian**: *Abjuration, Transmutation, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy*

#### Backfire:
- Partial Backfire: 
   - The spell burns you in return. This ignores all benefits. Take minor harm.
- Normal Backfire: 
   - The spell is out of fuel. Burn something inconvenient within range that matches the targets approximate volume. Might cause moderate damage.
- Incredible Backfire: 
   - Nothing burns as brightly as the fire of life itself. Your soul is sacrificed and utterly destroyed when you cast this spell, and one Attribute is stepped down twice. A volunteer can sacrifice their own soul instead. You may choose not to cast this spell.
