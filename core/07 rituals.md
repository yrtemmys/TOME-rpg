## Rituals
Multiple casters can band together to cast a single spell.

When casting in this manner, count up the spell rank each participant has in the school, and average it out, rounding down. Then add another revelation for each participant of the ritual.

From these Revelations, form a new temporary spell power pool for the spell.

Each participant counts as the caster, so a d12 on Targets or Range may still affect multiple creatures.

After successfully casting the spell, each participant notes it down in their spellbook, additonally noting the amount of required casters.

Example:

The witches coven of Bloodmarsh have 3 members with the following ranks in the Alchemy School:

- Sybil, Alchemy 2
- Francoir, Alchemy 3:
- Sapphire, Alchemy 3:

When they cast a spell in a ritual, they have (2+3+3)/3 = 8/3 ~= 2 average Revelations in Alchemy. Then each participant adds another Revelation, for a total of 5 Revelations.

From this, they form the following Spell Power Pool: 
- 0 SP: 5d20
- 1 SP: 5d12
- 2 SP: d10, 4d12
- 3 SP: 2d10, 3d12
- 4 SP: 3d10, 3d12
- 5 SP: 1d8, 2d10, 2d12 

This is a higher spell power pool than any of them could offer alone, and offers low ranking Apprentices and Novices the option to share the workload on casting spells.
Working together with your peers will lift all of you up, and while an Arch Mage will benefit an Apprentice in the ritual, the spell they cast together will be weaker than one an Arch Mage may cast themselves.
