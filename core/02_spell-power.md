## Spell Power
You have 6 spell power dice, one per spellcasting Attribute.
For any school you have no revalations in, they are a d20.
The first Revelation in a school puts them at a d12. 
Any further Revelations decrease the size of one die, down to a d4.
When you cast a new spell, assign a dice from your pool to each Attribute of spellcasting.
You may always choose to assign a lower step of die than available.
These Attributes and their steps are as follows:

	Casting Time: 
		d12: days
		d10: hours 
		 d8: minutes
		 d6: seconds 
		 d4: instant
	Effect: (Refer to the school in question) 
		d12: barely anything
		d10: the minimum
		 d8: basic stuff
		 d6: advanced stuff
		 d4: incredible stuff
	Duration: 
		d12: instant
		d10: minutes 
		 d8: hours 
		 d6: days 
		 d4: permanent
	Range: 
		d12: self 
		d10: touch
		 d8: short distance 
		 d6: distance
		 d4: eyesight
	Targets: 
		d12: self 
		d10: one
		 d8: a handfull 
		 d6: crowds
		 d4: cities
	Effort: 
		d12: life threatening
		d10: pain & vomit
		 d8: physical exertion 
		 d6: normal activity
		 d4: none 

If a spell inflicts harm, refer to the effect attribute die. A d12 does no harm, a d10 does minor, a d8 does moderate, a d6 and up do major.
