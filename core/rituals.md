## Rituals
Multiple casters can band together to cast a single spell.
When casting in this manner, combine the top 6 median dice of the spell power pools of the participants. This becomes the spell power pool for the spell.
For every 5 steps of dice beyond the median dice contributed to the spell, step down one of the dice within the spell power pool.

Example:
The witches coven of Bloodmarsh
