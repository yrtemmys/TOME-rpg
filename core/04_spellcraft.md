## Create a new Spell
At any time you may cast a brand new spell that's not in your spellbook. When you do so, roll all the dice within the spell power pool.
Take note of the lowest and highest numbers rolled. Refer to the lowest for the success state of the spell, and the highest for the backfire state. Evaluate both separately.
You only note down the Spell within your Spellbook, if you roll at least a partial success.

**Incredible success**: Reroll a die and keep the lower number.

**Normal Success**: You did it, you cast the spell.

**Partial success**: Reroll a die and keep the higher number.
No success: You fail to cast the spell. 

Backfire: Refer to the school of the spell. // A universal backfire table might be added as well, focusing less on the canon spell going wrong, and more on providing the GM with moves.

If you roll backfire, you can't create new spells of the same school, until the next session.[\*]
(Or a day has passed, if the concept of a session is irrelevant. i.e. solo play)

## Spellbook
Each time you create a new spell, note it down within your Spellbook. Give it a name and description, and note the Attribute dice used and the Backfire incurred.
When you reach a milestone of spells within your Spellbook, gain a Relevation.
When you cast a spell from your spellbook, roll the heighest die within the spell casting power pool and determine the results according to its result.

**Incredible Success**: Step down one of the attributes by one step for this casting.

**Normal Success**: You cast the spell.

**Partial Success**: Step up a random attribute by one step for this casting.

You incurr both the backfire of your die roll, as well as the noted backfire within the spells description.

When you gain a Relevation, you may choose one spell within your spellbook and reroll its spell power dice with Brilliance. Use your current spell power. 
Otherwise, when you try to achieve a similar enough effect to that of a spell noted in your spellbook you must cast that.
