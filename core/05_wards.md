## Wards [\*]
As a mage, you keep your fragile body safe through the power of wards. These aren't the first thing a mage learns, but the ones that don't, generally don't make it far in the world.
You know basic warding magic at rank 1.

There is a general purpose ward always protecting you, at a d20.
On top of that you have specialized wards, represented by your ward power (WP).
Ward power is a number of die steps you can go up from a d20. You can spend WP to create or upgrade your wards.
You start with 5 WP, and the Recalibrate Wards spell.

**Recalibrate Wards**:
> You recalibrate your ward power. Destroy all wards currently affecting you and reclaim their WP, resetting it to max. If temporary WP was gained, it fades away now.
> Spend 1 WP to create a new ward at a d12. Name this ward, it protects you against its named target.
>Instead of creating further wards, you may also increase the die step of an existing ward (except general purpose) by one, for each WP spent.
> d12 Cast: 8 hours
> d12 Effect
> d12 Duration: Instant
> d12 Target: self
> d12 Range:self
> d12 Effort: You fall unconscious upon casting this spell and sleep. Many mages use this as sleep aid.

When you take harm, roll the die of a relevant ward and refer to the following table:

| Success State     | Result                                                                                            |
| -                 | -                                                                                                 |
| Incredible Success| You absorb the energy of the blow. Gain 1 temporary WP, and upgrade your current ward up to a d4. |
| Normal Success	| You counter the incoming spell, deflect the blow, or generally avoid the danger.		   	        |
| Partial Success	| Your ward keeps you safe, but it still takes a hit. Move 1 WP from this ward to another.		    |
| No Success		| The damage breaks through your ward. Lose 1 WP from this ward.					                |

Harm comes in 3 varieties: Minor, Moderate and Major.
**Minor Harm**: You roll on your wards with Brilliance.
**Moderate Harm:** You roll once.
**Major Harm**: You roll on your wards blinded by Hubris.

Your ward can be differently effective against different things:
A [kinetic] ward is general enough to protect from many physical harms. 
A [blunt impact] ward on the other handgains increased effectiveness against blunt impacts due to its specialized nature, but reduced effectiveness against other physical threats.
If a ward is very effective, it reduces the incoming harm by one step, to a minimum of Minor.
If a ward is not very effective (and no other ward supercedes it), you may still use it to protect yourself, however it increases the incoming harm by one step, to a maximum of Major.

### Your wards have failed.
If none of your specialized wards apply, the general purpose ward still has a chance of protecting you.
When all fails and your WP drops to 0, taking any amount of harm will take you out of the scene. 
You may be trapped, thrown out of the room, fall unconscious, end up with a broken bone or missing limbs, or even die.
Describe what happens, and note down an appropriate consequence to the harm that took you out. 
Many bodily injuries heal with time, but may take you out of the campaign. Depending on the campaign howerver, restoring magic exists that could help you sooner.
Since this game only models rules for spellcasting, most consequences are purely affecting roleplay.
One consequence that affects gameplay, might be a burnt spellbook, losing you spells known and Relevations gained. 
The GM is advised to employ such only in moderation, as it rarely increases the enjoyment of the players.
