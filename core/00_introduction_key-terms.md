You're studying to be a wizard and will one day come to incredible arcane power. 
Or maybe you're one of those other stupid mages, ugh. All cheaters they are.

The game runs through dice scaling from a d4 to a d12 (or d20 if you suck real bad).
Rolling low is good, rolling high is bad. 
As you get better at stuff, the die you roll decreases in size.

All rolls are player facing.
You may be a little wizard shitling, but even you can cast magic. If you can roll, there is always a chance to succeed.

Key terms:
- Die Steps: A die step refers to the gap between the closest two dice. This game plays with the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20.
- Step up/down: A die can step up or down to the next size. For example, a d6 steps up to a d8, and a d10 steps down to a d12, which steps down to a d20.
- WP: Ward Power. The representation of how well protected you are.
- SP: Spell Power. A pool of dice you use when casting spells.
- Attributes: A spell is made up of these Attributes. They are: Effect, Casting time, Duration, Range, Targets, and Effort
- Brilliance: When you are especially brilliant, you gain an extra roll and keep the lower result.
- Hubris: When you are blinded by your own hubris, you gain an extra roll and keep the higher result.
 
Anything marked with a [*] is unique to the default magic system, not the rules themselves. It is advised to play with this, yet may be changed depending on the Campaign.
